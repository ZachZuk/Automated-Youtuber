# Automated-Youtuber

Getting Started:

I don't know how to do this very well so good luck!
You will need python and optionally git.
1. Clone the repository or just copy and paste main.py from the ama folder.
2. Create a reddit api key and replace "enter yours" with your keys.
3. Get edge webdriver and put it in the same folder.
4. Find any minecraft background video (crop it to 9:16 for short form content) and name it mcbgvid and place it in the same folder too (the longer the video the longer it takes to run)
5. Change the comment limit and the amount of videos generates as you like.
6. Run the program, you will see errors saying __ module not found. Run pip install [name of module].
7. Repeat until no more errors.
8. You should be good to go, have fun!
Let me know if there are any issues, im not good at readme's.
